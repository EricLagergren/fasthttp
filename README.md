# fasthttp
Fast HTTP implementation for Go.

Currently fasthttp is successfully used in a production serving up to 1M
concurrent keep-alive connections doing 100K qps from a single server.

# HTTP server performance comparison with [net/http](https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/)

In short, fasthttp is up to 10 times faster than net/http. Below are benchmark results.

# Performance optimization tips for multi-core systems

* Use [reuseport](https://godoc.org/github.com/valyala/fasthttp/reuseport) listener.
* Run a separate server instance per CPU core with GOMAXPROCS=1.
* Pin each server instance to a separate CPU core using [taskset](http://linux.die.net/man/1/taskset).
* Ensure the interrupts of multiqueue network card are evenly distributed between CPU cores.
  See [this article](https://blog.cloudflare.com/how-to-achieve-low-latency/) for details.


# Fasthttp best practicies

* Do not allocate objects and `[]byte` buffers - just reuse them as much
  as possible. Fasthttp API design encourages this.
* [sync.Pool](https://golang.org/pkg/sync/#Pool) is your best friend.
* [Profile your program](http://blog.golang.org/profiling-go-programs)
  in production.
  `go tool pprof --alloc_objects your-program mem.pprof` usually gives better
  insights for optimization opportunities than `go tool pprof your-program cpu.pprof`.
* Write [tests and benchmarks](https://golang.org/pkg/testing/) for hot paths.
* Avoid conversion between `[]byte` and `string`, since this may result in memory
  allocation+copy. Fasthttp API provides functions for both `[]byte` and `string` -
  use these functions instead of converting manually between `[]byte` and `string`.
* Verify your tests and production code under
  [race detector](https://golang.org/doc/articles/race_detector.html) on a regular basis.


# FAQ

* *Why creating yet another http package instead of optimizing net/http?*

  Because net/http API limits many optimization opportunities.
  For example:
  * net/http Request object lifetime isn't limited by request handler execution
    time. So the server must create new request object per each request instead
    of reusing existing objects like fasthttp do.
  * net/http headers are stored in a `map[string][]string`. So the server
    must parse all the headers, convert them from `[]byte` to `string` and put
    them into the map before calling user-provided request handler.
    This all requires unnesessary memory allocations avoided by fasthttp.
  * net/http client API requires creating new response object per each request.

* *Why fasthttp API is incompatible with net/http?*

  Because net/http API limits many optimization opportunities. See the answer
  above for more details. Also certain net/http API parts are suboptimal
  for use:
  * Compare [net/http connection hijacking](https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/#Hijacker)
    to [fasthttp connection hijacking](https://godoc.org/github.com/valyala/fasthttp#RequestCtx.Hijack).
  * Compare [net/http Request.Body reading](https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/#Request)
    to [fasthttp request body reading](https://godoc.org/github.com/valyala/fasthttp#RequestCtx.PostBody).

* *Why fasthttp doesn't support HTTP/2.0 and WebSockets?*

  There are [plans](TODO) for adding HTTP/2.0 and WebSockets support
  in the future.
  In the mean time, third parties may use [RequestCtx.Hijack](https://godoc.org/github.com/valyala/fasthttp#RequestCtx.Hijack)
  for implementing these goodies.

* *Are there known net/http advantages comparing to fasthttp?*

  Yes:
  * net/http supports [HTTP/2.0 starting from go1.6](https://http2.golang.org/).
  * net/http API is stable, while fasthttp API may change at any time.
  * net/http handles more HTTP corner cases.
  * net/http should contain less bugs, since it is used and tested by much
    wider user base.
  * Many existing web frameworks and request routers are built on top
    of net/http.
  * net/http works on go older than 1.5.

* *Which GO versions are supported by fasthttp?*

  Go1.5+. Older versions won't be supported, since their standard package
  [miss useful functions](https://github.com/valyala/fasthttp/issues/5).

* *Please provide real benchmark data and sever information*

  See [this issue](https://github.com/valyala/fasthttp/issues/4).

* *Are there plans to add request routing to fasthttp?*

  There are no plans to add request routing into fasthttp. I believe request
  routing must be implemented in a separate package(s) like
  [httprouter](https://github.com/julienschmidt/httprouter).
  See [this issue](https://github.com/valyala/fasthttp/issues/8) for more info.
